# Assign the value "Kaelyn" to the variable name 
name = "Kaelyn"
age = 15 

# Say hello 
print("Hello!")

# Ask the user how old they are 
# - overwrite the value in the age variable 
# - use the input() function

# Ask the user how old they are 
print("so...how old are you?")
age = input("How old are you?")

# Tell the user how old they are
    #- You'll need to use the age variable
    #- You'll need to use f-string 
print(f"You are {age} years old")

# Ask the use for their name
# Store it in a variable 
print("so.. what's your name?")
name = input()
# Greet the user using their name 
print (f"It's nice to meet you {name}")
